# OpenCode Rules

This document explains how to use OpenCode Rules to inject custom instructions into the agent's system prompt. Rules are automatically discovered and injected via OpenCode's hook system, enabling context-aware rule filtering based on file paths, user prompts, and available tools.

## Rule Files

Rules are defined in Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdc`). These files can be located in two places:

- **Global Rules:** `~/.config/opencode/rules/`
- **Project Rules:** `.opencode/rules/` in the root of your project.

Both directories are scanned **recursively**, so you can organize your rules into subdirectories. Rule discovery happens once when the plugin initializes.

### Organizing Rules with Subdirectories

You can create subdirectories to group related rules:

```
~/.config/opencode/rules/
├── coding-standards.md       # Root-level rule (always applied)
├── languages/
│   ├── typescript.mdc        # TypeScript-specific (conditional)
│   └── python.mdc            # Python-specific (conditional)
├── frameworks/
│   ├── react.mdc             # React rules
│   └── nextjs.mdc            # Next.js rules
└── workflows/
    ├── testing.md            # Testing guidelines
    └── git.md                # Git commit conventions
```

Hidden files and directories (starting with `.`) are automatically excluded from discovery.

## Conditional Rules

You can define conditional rules in both `.md` and `.mdc` files using YAML frontmatter with `globs` and/or `keywords` fields.

### File-Based Conditions (globs)

The `globs` key contains a list of glob patterns. The rule applies if any file in the conversation context matches one of the patterns.

```markdown
---
globs:
  - 'src/components/**/*.ts'
---

This is a rule for TypeScript components.
```

### Prompt-Based Conditions (keywords)

The `keywords` key contains a list of keywords. The rule applies if the user's prompt contains any of the keywords (case-insensitive matching).

```markdown
---
keywords:
  - 'testing'
  - 'unit test'
  - 'jest'
---

Follow these testing best practices.
```

#### Keyword Matching Behavior

The matching system is language-aware and supports wildcards:

**English Keywords:**
- Word-boundary matching is applied (e.g., "test" matches "testing")
- Does NOT match mid-word (e.g., "test" does NOT match "contest")

**Chinese/CJK Keywords:**
- Substring matching by default (no word boundaries in CJK languages)
- `开发技能` matches "帮我开发技能吧", "开发技能很重要"

**Wildcard Support (`*`):**
Use `*` for flexible matching when you need to handle variations:

```markdown
---
keywords:
  - '开发*技能'
  - 'deploy*skill'
---
```

- `开发*技能` matches "请开发一个技能", "开发游戏技能"
- `deploy*skill` matches "deploy my skill", "deploy an awesome skill"
- `*deploy*` removes leading boundary, matches "autodeploy"

**Mixed Language Keywords:**
Boundary behavior is determined by the first character:
- `app部署` (English first) → word boundary applies → matches "start app部署", NOT "testapp部署"
- `部署app` (Chinese first) → no boundary → matches "自动部署app"

#### Quick Reference

| Pattern | Type | Example Match |
|---------|------|---------------|
| `test` | English | "testing code" ✓, "contest" ✗ |
| `开发技能` | Chinese | "帮我开发技能吧" ✓ |
| `开发*技能` | Wildcard | "开发一个新技能" ✓ |
| `*test*` | Wildcard | "contest", "testing" ✓ |

### Combined Conditions (OR logic)

You can use both `globs` and `keywords` together. The rule applies if EITHER condition matches:

```markdown
---
globs:
  - '**/*.test.ts'
keywords:
  - 'testing'
---

Testing standards for the project.
```

This rule applies when EITHER a test file is in context OR the user mentions testing.

### Unconditional Rules

If no `globs` or `keywords` are specified, the rule is applied unconditionally to all prompts.

## How Rules are Loaded and Injected

The plugin uses OpenCode's hook system to track context and inject rules:

1. **Context Tracking**:
   - `tool.execute.before` hook captures file paths as tools execute (read, edit, write, glob, grep, etc.)
   - `chat.message` hook captures the latest user prompt as messages arrive
   - `experimental.chat.messages.transform` hook seeds session state from message history on first call only

2. **Rule Injection**:
   - `experimental.chat.system.transform` hook evaluates all discovered rules against the accumulated context
   - Rules are filtered based on:
     - **File paths**: Glob patterns matched against files in context (from tool calls and message history)
     - **User prompts**: Keyword matching against the latest user message
     - **Available tools**: Exact match against tool IDs available in the current environment
   - Matching rules are formatted and appended to the system prompt

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - `experimental.session.compacting` hook preserves context paths during session compression
   - This ensures rules remain applicable after session compaction

## Rule Matching Examples

### Scenario 1: TypeScript File Context

- User edits `src/components/Button.tsx` (captured by `tool.execute.before`)
- Plugin evaluates rules with `globs: ['**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx']`
- TypeScript rules are injected into system prompt

### Scenario 2: User Mentions Testing

- User types prompt: "How do I write unit tests for this function?"
- `chat.message` hook captures the prompt
- Plugin evaluates rules with `keywords: ['testing', 'unit test']`
- Testing rules are injected into system prompt

### Scenario 3: Tool-Based Rules

- OpenCode provides websearch tool
- Plugin evaluates rules with `tools: ['mcp_websearch']`
- Web search best practices rules are injected

### Scenario 4: Combined Conditions

- A rule has both `globs: ['**/*.test.ts']` and `keywords: ['testing']`
- Rule is injected if EITHER condition matches (OR logic)
- File context OR user prompt will trigger the rule
